I recently completed a Bookstore Website as a practice project to enhance my frontend and JavaScript skills. ðŸ’»âœ¨

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:
âœ… HTML & CSS â€“ For structuring and styling the website
âœ… JavaScript (JS) â€“ For dynamic interactions
âœ… JSON â€“ To manage and display book data

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
ðŸ“– A book listing section dynamically loaded from a JSON file
ðŸ›’ Interactive UI with smooth navigation
ðŸ“± Fully responsive design

This project was a great learning experience in working with JSON for data handling and improving frontend development skills. Excited to take on more challenges! ðŸš€
